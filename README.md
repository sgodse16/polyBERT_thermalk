# polyBERT_thermalk
Predicting thermal conductivity of 1 million polymers (<a href=https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jcim.0c00726>PI1M</a>) using <a href=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-023-39868-6>pretrained polyBERT</a>, finetuned using 1070 polymers from <a href=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41524-022-00906-4>RadonPy</a>.

Due to size limits, the data and trained model are uploaded on drive: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1cfjqpW510RmQAzMEkFc9GzrxXgTsPySC?usp=sharing.
